**Floo** is a lightweight, secure tunneling toolkit that lets you:
- 🔒 Access private services through encrypted tunnels
- 🌐 Expose local services to the internet securely
- ⚡ Achieve multi-gigabit throughput (22-31 Gbps with hardware crypto)
- 🧠 Auto-scale tunnels to your CPU cores and pin them to dedicated threads
- 📦 Deploy a single static binary with zero dependencies

Written in Zig with modern cryptography (Noise XX protocol), Floo provides both **forward tunneling** (reach into private networks) and **reverse tunneling** (expose local services) with strong authentication.

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

<details>
<summary><b>Access your home database from anywhere</b></summary>

Run `floos` on a public VPS and `flooc` on your home server. Connect to localhost:5432 on your laptop to reach your home PostgreSQL instance.

```bash
# On VPS (floos.toml):
[services]
postgres = "10.0.0.5:5432"

# On laptop (flooc.toml):
[services]
postgres = "127.0.0.1:5432"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Share your home media server (Jellyfin/Plex)</b></summary>

Expose your local Jellyfin server to friends without opening router ports or using dynamic DNS.

```bash
# On VPS (floos.toml):
[reverse_services]
media = "0.0.0.0:8096"

# On home server (flooc.toml):
[reverse_services]
media = "127.0.0.1:8096"
```

Friends access `http://your-vps:8096` → your home Jellyfin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Work through a corporate firewall</b></summary>

Your company blocks everything except HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Floo can tunnel through SOCKS5 or HTTP CONNECT proxies.

```bash
# flooc.toml:
[advanced]
proxy_url = "socks5://corporate-proxy:1080"
```
</details>

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Floo

**Download prebuilt binaries:**
- [Latest release](https://github.com/NTETV/floo/releases/latest)
- [Nightly builds](https://github.com/NTETV/floo/releases/tag/nightly)

Windows release bundles also include `floo-windows.ps1`, a native PowerShell manager for per-user client instances:
```powershell
Expand-Archive .\floo-x86_64-windows.zip -DestinationPath .
cd .\floo-x86_64-windows
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 help
```

macOS release bundles also include `floo-macos.sh`, a terminal manager for user-level `launchd` instances:
```bash
tar xzf floo-aarch64-macos.tar.gz   # or floo-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
cd floo-aarch64-macos
bash floo-macos.sh status
```

Or **build from source**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NTETV/floo.git
cd floo
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
# Binaries in: zig-out/bin/
```

### Step 2: Generate Strong Credentials

⚠️ **Security First**: Never use default or weak credentials!

```bash
# Generate a strong PSK (Pre-Shared Key)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate a strong token
openssl rand -base64 24
```

Save these somewhere secure - you'll need them for both server and client.

### Step 3: Configure the Server (VPS/Public Machine)

Copy the example config:
```bash
cp configs/floos.example.toml floos.toml
```

Edit `floos.toml` and set your **real credentials**:
```toml
bind = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8443
cipher = "aes256gcm"
psk = "YOUR_GENERATED_PSK_HERE"        # ← Paste your openssl output
token = "YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN_HERE"    # ← Paste your openssl output

[services]
# Example: allow clients to reach an internal database
database = "10.0.0.5:5432"

[reverse_services]
# Example: accept connections from clients and expose on port 8096
media = "0.0.0.0:8096"
```

### Step 4: Configure the Client (Home/Local Machine)

Copy the example config:
```bash
cp configs/flooc.example.toml flooc.toml
```

Edit `flooc.toml` with the **same credentials**:
```toml
server = "your-vps-ip:8443"            # ← Your VPS address
cipher = "aes256gcm"
psk = "YOUR_GENERATED_PSK_HERE"        # ← Must match server!
token = "YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN_HERE"    # ← Must match server!

[services]
# Listen locally and connect through tunnel to server's "database" service
database = "127.0.0.1:5432"

[reverse_services]
# Expose your local media server through the tunnel
media = "127.0.0.1:8096"
```

### Step 5: Start the Tunnel

**On the server (VPS):**
```bash
./floos floos.toml
# [SERVER] Port: 8443
# [SERVER] Mode: Blocking I/O + Threads
```

**On the client (home machine):**
```bash
./flooc flooc.toml
# [CLIENT] Connected to tunnel server
# [CLIENT] All services started
```

### Step 6: Test It

If you configured the database example:
```bash
# On your laptop (where flooc is running):
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432
# You're now connected to your home database through the encrypted tunnel!
```

If you configured reverse media sharing:
```bash
# From anywhere on the internet:
curl http://your-vps-ip:8096
# You're accessing your home media server!
```

## 📖 Understanding Forward vs Reverse Modes

### Forward Mode: Reach Into Private Networks

**Scenario**: You have a database at home, want to access it from your laptop.

```
┌─────────┐    encrypted    ┌─────────┐              ┌──────────┐
│ Laptop  │───────tunnel────│   VPS   │──────────────│ Home DB  │
│ (you)   │                 │ (floos) │    local     │ 10.0.0.5 │
└─────────┘                 └─────────┘              └──────────┘
 flooc
 connects to                 defines [services]
 127.0.0.1:5432             database = "10.0.0.5:5432"
```

**Client config** (`flooc.toml`): Local listener
```toml
[services]
database = "127.0.0.1:5432"
```

**Server config** (`floos.toml`): Target location
```toml
[services]
database = "10.0.0.5:5432"
```

### Reverse Mode: Expose Local Services

**Scenario**: Share your home media server with friends.

```
┌─────────┐              ┌─────────┐     encrypted   ┌──────────┐
│ Friend  │──────────────│   VPS   │───────tunnel────│ Home     │
│ Browser │   internet   │ (floos) │                 │ Jellyfin │
└─────────┘              └─────────┘                 └──────────┘
                         binds on                     flooc
connects to              0.0.0.0:8096                 exposes
your-vps:8096            [reverse_services]          127.0.0.1:8096
```

**Server config** (`floos.toml`): Public listener
```toml
[reverse_services]
media = "0.0.0.0:8096"
```

**Client config** (`flooc.toml`): Local service
```toml
[reverse_services]
media = "127.0.0.1:8096"
```

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Reference

### Minimal Config

The simplest possible setup:

**floos.toml** (server):
```toml
port = 8443
psk = "your-strong-psk-here"
token = "your-strong-token-here"

[services]
web = "10.0.0.10:80"
```

**flooc.toml** (client):
```toml
server = "vps.example.com:8443"
psk = "your-strong-psk-here"
token = "your-strong-token-here"

[services]
web = "127.0.0.1:8080"
```

### Cipher Options

Choose based on your hardware:

| Cipher | Single Stream | Multi-Stream (4x) | Hardware Acceleration | Use When |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| `aegis128l` | **22.1 Gbps** | **7.7 Gbps** | ARMv8, x86 AES-NI | Modern CPU, max speed |
| `aegis256` | **19.2 Gbps** | **7.4 Gbps** | ARMv8, x86 AES-NI | Modern CPU, max security |
| `aes128gcm` | **14.5 Gbps** | **5.9 Gbps** | ARMv8, x86 AES-NI | Modern CPU, compatibility |
| `aes256gcm` | **13.4 Gbps** | **5.6 Gbps** | ARMv8, x86 AES-NI | Modern CPU, standard choice |
| `chacha20poly1305` | **3.4 Gbps** | **2.3 Gbps** | Software-only | Older CPU, mobile devices |
| `none` (plaintext) | **30.9 Gbps** | **9.6 Gbps** | N/A | Debug/testing only |

**Performance tested on Apple M1 (4 vCPU). Single stream = optimal throughput, Multi-stream = realistic concurrent usage.**

### Per-Service Tokens

Add extra security by requiring different tokens per service:

```toml
token = "default-token"

[services]
web = "10.0.0.10:80"
web.token = "public-web-token"

database = "10.0.0.20:5432"
database.token = "sensitive-db-token"
```

Clients must use the matching token to access each service.

### UDP Support

Tunnel UDP traffic (DNS, VoIP, games):

```toml
[services]
dns = "8.8.8.8:53/udp"
voip = "10.0.0.30:5060/udp"
```

### Advanced Performance Tuning

```toml
[advanced]
socket_buffer_size = 4194304      # 4MB buffers for high throughput
num_tunnels = 0                   # 0 = auto, capped at 4 active tunnels by default
pin_threads = true                # Pin tunnel handlers to CPU cores
io_batch_bytes = 131072           # Per-stream I/O buffer size
tcp_nodelay = true                # Disable Nagle for lower latency
heartbeat_interval_seconds = 30   # Keepalive frequency
```

> ℹ️ **num_tunnels**: leave at `0` to auto-scale based on CPU count, but cap the default at `4` active tunnels. Set an explicit number only when you need fewer tunnels or deliberately boost fan-out.
>
> ℹ️ **pin_threads**: keeps each tunnel on a dedicated core (Linux/Unix). Disable only if your scheduler forbids manual affinity.
>
> ℹ️ **io_batch_bytes**: per-stream read/write buffer size. Increase for jumbo frames or high-latency satellite links; decrease for memory-constrained devices.

| **Windows x86_64** | `floo-x86_64-windows.zip` | Native PowerShell client manager |

Download from [releases page](https://github.com/NTETV/floo/releases).

macOS archives also ship `floo-macos.sh` for terminal-based instance management on user-level `launchd`.
Windows archives also ship `floo-windows.ps1` for terminal-based client management without WSL or Git Bash.

---

## 🪟 Windows PowerShell manager

`floo-windows.ps1` provides a native Windows workflow for managing per-user `flooc` client instances without WSL, Git Bash, or administrator-only services.

### Managed directories

- Configs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Floo\configs\`
- Installed binaries: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Floo\bin\`
- Logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Floo\logs\`
- State: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Floo\state\`

Each instance gets its own config, PID/state record, stdout log, stderr log, and optional per-user scheduled task.

### Quick start

From a Windows release archive:

```powershell
Expand-Archive .\floo-x86_64-windows.zip -DestinationPath .
cd .\floo-x86_64-windows
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 help
```

Import a client preset generated by Linux `floo.sh` or macOS `floo-macos.sh`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 import-client --preset=xxxxxx --client-target=127.0.0.1:1080
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 status
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 logs <id>
```

### Supported commands

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 import-client --preset=... --client-target=127.0.0.1:1080
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 start <id>
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 stop <id>
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 restart <id>
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 status [id]
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 list
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 logs [id]
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 enable-autostart <id>
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 disable-autostart <id>
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 delete <id>
```

Use `--all` with `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `enable-autostart`, `disable-autostart`, and `delete` to operate on every managed client instance.

### `import-client` compatibility

The `--preset` payload is shared across Linux, macOS, and Windows. A preset generated by Linux `floo.sh` or macOS `floo-macos.sh` can be imported directly on Windows without conversion.

### Verification checklist

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 help
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\floo-windows.ps1 status
```

---

## 🍎 macOS launchd manager

`floo-macos.sh` provides a terminal-first macOS workflow that mirrors the Linux `floo.sh` instance model, but uses user-level `launchd` instead of `systemd`.

### Managed directories

- Configs: `~/Library/Application Support/Floo/configs/`
- Managed plists: `~/Library/Application Support/Floo/plists/`
- Installed binaries: `~/Library/Application Support/Floo/bin/`
- LaunchAgents: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/Floo/`

Each instance gets its own config, launchd label, and stdout/stderr log files:

- Server label: `com.ntetv.floo.server.<id>`
- Client label: `com.ntetv.floo.client.<id>`

### Quick start

From a release archive on macOS:

```bash
tar xzf floo-aarch64-macos.tar.gz   # or floo-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
cd floo-aarch64-macos
bash floo-macos.sh add
bash floo-macos.sh list
bash floo-macos.sh status
```

From source:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
bash floo-macos.sh status
```

The script prefers local `floos`/`flooc` binaries next to itself or in `zig-out/bin/`. If they are missing, it downloads the latest matching macOS release asset automatically.

### Supported commands

```bash
bash floo-macos.sh add
bash floo-macos.sh delete <id>
bash floo-macos.sh start <id>
bash floo-macos.sh stop <id>
bash floo-macos.sh restart <id>
bash floo-macos.sh status [id]
bash floo-macos.sh list
bash floo-macos.sh logs [id]
bash floo-macos.sh enable-autostart <id>
bash floo-macos.sh disable-autostart <id>
bash floo-macos.sh import-client --preset=... --client-target=127.0.0.1:1080
```

Use `--all` with `delete`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `enable-autostart`, and `disable-autostart` to operate on every managed instance.

### `import-client` compatibility

The `--preset` payload is shared with the Linux manager. A preset generated by Linux `floo.sh` can be imported directly on macOS:

```bash
bash floo-macos.sh import-client --preset=xxxxxx --client-target=127.0.0.1:1080
```

This creates a macOS client config, generates `com.ntetv.floo.client.<id>.plist`, and starts it with `launchctl`.

### Verification checklist

```bash
bash -n floo-macos.sh
bash floo-macos.sh list
bash floo-macos.sh status
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.ntetv.floo.server.<id>
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.ntetv.floo.client.<id>
```

If your session does not expose a GUI launch domain, replace `gui/$(id -u)` with `user/$(id -u)`.

For logs:

```bash
bash floo-macos.sh logs <id>
tail -f "$HOME/Library/Logs/Floo/com.ntetv.floo.server.<id>.out.log"
```

## ⚡ Performance

Benchmarked on Apple M1 (4 vCPU), 1 second duration:

### Single Stream (Optimal Throughput)

| Cipher | Forward | Reverse | vs FRP | vs Rathole |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Plaintext** | **30.9 Gbps** | **30.5 Gbps** | **3.4x faster** | **1.9x faster** |
| **AEGIS-128L** | **22.1 Gbps** | **23.3 Gbps** | **2.4x faster** | **1.3x faster** |
| **AEGIS-256** | **19.2 Gbps** | **21.2 Gbps** | **2.1x faster** | **1.2x faster** |
| **AES-128-GCM** | **14.5 Gbps** | **16.2 Gbps** | **1.6x faster** | Similar |
| **AES-256-GCM** | **13.4 Gbps** | **14.1 Gbps** | **1.5x faster** | Similar |
| **ChaCha20** | **3.4 Gbps** | **3.4 Gbps** | Similar | 0.5x |

*FRP: 9.2 Gbps, Rathole: 16.6 Gbps (single stream baseline)*

### Multi-Stream (4 Concurrent Streams)

| Cipher | Forward | Reverse | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Plaintext** | **9.6 Gbps** | **9.6 Gbps** | Still 3x faster than FRP |
| **AEGIS-128L** | **7.7 Gbps** | **7.9 Gbps** | Best encrypted option |
| **AES-256-GCM** | **5.6 Gbps** | **5.5 Gbps** | Widely compatible |
| **ChaCha20** | **2.3 Gbps** | **2.3 Gbps** | Software fallback |

**Key Takeaway**: For maximum throughput, use single streams with AEGIS-128L. For multiple concurrent connections, performance scales linearly with CPU cores.

# 🔍 Built-in Runtime Metrics

Every `floos`/`flooc` process keeps live counters for:

- **Encryption time** – total nanoseconds spent encrypting/decrypting plus average cost per frame.
- **Throughput** – cumulative plaintext bytes transmitted (tx) and received (rx) per tunnel.

Dump a snapshot at any time with `SIGUSR1`, or just stop the process cleanly:

```bash
kill -USR1 $(pgrep floos)   # server side
kill -USR1 $(pgrep flooc)   # client side
```

Sample output:

```
[PROFILE] server encryption total=12000 ns calls=14 avg=857 ns
[PROFILE] server throughput tx=865 bytes (0.00 MB) rx=9649744503 bytes (9202.71 MB)
```

### When it’s useful

- **Capacity planning / billing** – snapshot tx/rx periodically to see true payload volume.
- **Benchmark verification** – correlate iperf results with tunnel counters when tuning ciphers or kernels.
- **Health monitoring** – alert when payload volume drops unexpectedly or encryption costs spike (CPU pressure).

Because the counters are always on in the data path, there’s no extra agent to run—just signal the process and parse the two log lines.
